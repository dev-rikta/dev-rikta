🚀 Aspiring Web Developer | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Laravel

I’m a passionate beginner web developer currently building a solid foundation in front-end and back-end technologies. My journey started with HTML and CSS, and I’m now diving deeper into JavaScript for dynamic interfaces and PHP with Laravel for server-side development.

🔧 What I'm Learning:

Responsive web design with HTML5 & CSS3

JavaScript fundamentals for interactive features

PHP for backend logic and data handling

Laravel framework to build modern web applications

🛠️ I enjoy experimenting with small projects, learning from real-world examples, and contributing to open-source when possible. Every day is an opportunity to grow and improve my skills.

🌱 I’m looking to connect with other developers, learn from mentors, and eventually contribute to professional projects. Excited to be a part of the tech community!
